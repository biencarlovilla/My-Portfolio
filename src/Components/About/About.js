        <p id="hello">Hello, I'm Biencarlo</p>
        <p> As an aspiring professional in the tech field, my goal is to get a job in a company where I can utilize my 
            skills and improve my career path. Coming from a financial company, I was able to further my knowledge and 
            expose myself on a day to day basis of an effective working environment. Iâ€™m confident that I can apply 
            these experiences and be valuable to a company. I grew up in the Philippines and I've 
            been living in the Bay Area. Some fun facts about me is that I play chess. </p>
